Markov Chain - Emily Dickinson First Line Generator

Overview:
Using data scraped from Porject Gutenberg, the program builds
a Markov Chain using Emily Dickinson's poems - specificially, 
the first lines of every poem she has written. Using the chain,
it generates a line of poetry in the style of EMily Dickinson.

Known Issues/Bugs:
Grammar rules are still being ironed out, as the generated lines
usually output nonsensical words around half the time

Libraries Needed:
requests
bs4
lxml
nltk
